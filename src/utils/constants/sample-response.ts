Hello! After analyzing 'Blurred Lines', I found it highly similar to Marvin Gaye's 'Got to Give It Up', posing a legal risk.
Your track has a Similarity Score of 60 and an Originality Score of 28. To reduce legal risks, aim for below 40 in Similarity and above 40 in Originality.
Here are key tips:
1. Adjust Tempo: Change from 120 BPM to either 105-110 or 130-135 BPM to shift the song's energy.
2. Change Chord Progression: Swap the I-IV-V progression for something like I-V-vi-IV or ii-V-I to alter the harmonic feel.
3. Rethink Instrumentation: Replace the cowbell and electric piano with unique sounds, like bongos or a synth pad.
3. Vocal Melody: Modify your chorus melody's rhythm and pitch pattern to differentiate it.
By implementing these changes, your track's projected scores are Similarity: 30, & Originality: 53, effectively mitigating legal risks and enchancing originality.
